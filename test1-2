1,

SELECT gender as Gender, AVG(duration) as avg 
FROM customers INNER JOIN calls
ON (customers.id = calls.caller_id OR customers.id = calls.callee_id)
GROUP BY gender;

2,

SELECT count(*) from parents INNER JOIN children
  ON parents.NAME LIKE concat('%', children.FAMILY_NAME, '%')

SELECT count(*) from parents INNER JOIN children
  ON parents.FAMILY_NAME = children.FAMILY_NAME

I think the second query has faster runtime with bigger input
